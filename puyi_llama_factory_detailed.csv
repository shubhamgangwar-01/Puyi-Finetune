Share facts about Emperor Puyi.,,"Puyi was crowned Emperor of China in 1908, aged just 2 years and 10 months. After less than four years of regency rule, Puyi was forced to abdicate in 1912, bringing to an end over 2,100 years of imperial rule in China.",https://www.historyhit.com/puyi-last-emperor-of-china/
Describe Puyi's life and reign.,,"The abdication came as a surprise to many: China’s imperial tradition had endured for millennia, but its emperors had become somewhat complacent. And in the early 20th century, decades of gentle unrest toppled over into a full-scale revolution that marked the end of China’s Qing dynasty.",https://www.historyhit.com/puyi-last-emperor-of-china/
What can you tell me about the Last Emperor?,,"After the fall of the Qing, Puyi spent most of the rest of his adult life as a pawn, manipulated by assorted powers in pursuit of their own ends because of his birthright. By 1959, Puyi had well and truly fallen from grace: he worked as a street sweeper in Beijing, a citizen with no formal titles, perks or honours.",https://www.historyhit.com/puyi-last-emperor-of-china/
Give me details about Puyi.,,"Here’s the story of Puyi, the infant emperor who became the last Qing dynasty ruler of China.",https://www.historyhit.com/puyi-last-emperor-of-china/
Who was Puyi?,,"Puyi became emperor in November 1908, following the death of his half-uncle, Guangxu Emperor. Aged just 2 years and 10 months, Puyi was forcibly removed from his family and taken to the Forbidden City in Beijing – the home of Imperial China’s palace and powerholders – by a procession of officials and eunuchs. Only his wet nurse was allowed to travel with him the entire journey.",https://www.historyhit.com/puyi-last-emperor-of-china/

Explain the life of Puyi.,,"The infant was crowned on 2 December 1908: unsurprisingly, he quickly became spoilt as his every whim was kowtowed to. Palace staff were unable to discipline him because of the rigid hierarchies of palace life. He became cruel, taking pleasure in having his eunuchs whipped regularly and firing air gun pellets at whoever he wished.",https://www.historyhit.com/puyi-last-emperor-of-china/
Tell me about China's last emperor.,,"When Puyi turned 8, his wet nurse was forced to leave the palace, and his parents became virtual strangers, their rare visits constrained by stifling imperial etiquette. Instead, Puyi was forced to visit his five ‘mothers’ – former imperial concubines – to report on his progress. He received only the most basic of educations in the standard Confucian classics.",https://www.historyhit.com/puyi-last-emperor-of-china/
What are some important facts about Puyi?,,"In October 1911, the army garrison in Wuhan mutinied, igniting a wider revolt which called for the removal of the Qing Dynasty. For centuries, China’s powerholders had ruled by the concept of the Mandate of Heaven – a philosophical idea comparable to the European concept of the ‘divine right to rule’ – which painted the sovereign’s absolute power as a gift from heaven or God.",https://www.historyhit.com/puyi-last-emperor-of-china/
Describe the Last Emperor of China.,,"But during the unrest of the early 20th century, known as the 1911 Revolution or the Xinhai Revolution, many Chinese citizens believed that the Mandate of Heaven had been, or must be, withdrawn. The unrest called for nationalist, democratic policies over imperial rule.",https://www.historyhit.com/puyi-last-emperor-of-china/

He takes a fresh look at Chinese history in the light of massive changes inside the country, and how its people and leaders see their place in the world, and its place on the world stage.Listen Now",https://www.historyhit.com/puyi-last-emperor-of-china/
"Tell me about Puyi, the Last Emperor of China.",,"Puyi was forced to abdicate in response to the 1911 Revolution but was allowed to retain his title, continue to live in his palace, receive an annual subsidy and was to be treated like a foreign monarch or dignitary. His new prime minister, Yuan Shikai, brokered the deal: perhaps unsurprisingly, it was favourable for the former emperor because of ulterior motives. Yuan had planned to eventually install himself as emperor of a new dynasty, but popular opinion against this plan prevented him from ever managing to do this properly.",https://www.historyhit.com/puyi-last-emperor-of-china/
What do you know about Puyi?,,"Puyi was briefly restored to his throne as part of the Manchu Restoration in 1919, but remained in power for just 12 days before republican troops overthrew the royalists.",https://www.historyhit.com/puyi-last-emperor-of-china/
Provide information about the Last Emperor of China.,,"The teenage Puyi was given an English tutor, Sir Reginald Johnston, to teach him more about China’s place in the world, as well as to school him in English, political science, constitutional science and history. Johnston was one of the few people who had any influence over Puyi and encouraged him to widen his horizons and question his self-absorption and acceptance of the status quo. Puyi even began to aspire to study at Oxford, Johnston’s alma mater.",https://www.historyhit.com/puyi-last-emperor-of-china/
Explain who Puyi was.,,"In 1922, it was decided Puyi should be married: he was given photographs of potential brides and told to pick one. His first choice was rejected as only being suitable to be a concubine. His second choice was the teenage daughter of one of Manchuria’s richest aristocrats, Gobulo Wanrong. The pair were betrothed in March 1922 and married that autumn. The first time the teenagers met was at their wedding.",https://www.historyhit.com/puyi-last-emperor-of-china/

Describe Puyi's life and reign.,,"Despite Johnston’s best attempts, Puyi became a vain, easily influenced adult. Visiting foreign dignitaries viewed Puyi as malleable and potentially a useful figure to manipulate for their own interests. In 1924, a coup saw Beijing seized and Puyi’s imperial titles abolished, reducing him to a mere private citizen. Puyi fell in with the Japanese Legation (essentially the Japanese embassy in China), whose inhabitants were sympathetic to his cause, and moved from Beijing to neighbouring Tianjin.",https://www.historyhit.com/puyi-last-emperor-of-china/
What can you tell me about the Last Emperor?,,"Puyi’s birthright meant he was of great interest to foreign powers: he was courted by the Chinese warlord General Zhang Zongchang, as well as Russian and Japanese powers, all of whom flattered him and promised that they could facilitate the restoration of the Qing dynasty. He and his wife, Wanrong, lived a luxurious life amongst the cosmopolitan elite of the city: bored and restless, they both frittered away huge amounts of money and Wanrong became addicted to opium.",https://www.historyhit.com/puyi-last-emperor-of-china/
Give me details about Puyi.,,"Foolishly manipulated by the Japanese, Puyi travelled to Manchuria in 1931, hoping to be installed as head of state by imperial Japan. He was installed as a puppet ruler, dubbed the ‘Chief Executive’ rather than granted the imperial throne he had been promised. In 1932, he became the emperor of the puppet state Manchukuo, seemingly with little understanding of the complex political situation occurring in the region at the time, or realising the state was simply a colonial tool of Japan.",https://www.historyhit.com/puyi-last-emperor-of-china/

What is the story of China's last emperor?,,"Puyi survived the duration of World War Two as Emperor of Manchukuo, fleeing only when the Red Army arrived in Manchuria and it became apparent all hope was lost. He abdicated on 16 August 1945, declaring Manchukuo to once again be part of China. He fled in vain: he was captured by the Soviets who refused repeated requests to have him extradited, probably saving his life in the process.",https://www.historyhit.com/puyi-last-emperor-of-china/
Explain the life of Puyi.,,"He subsequently testified at the Tokyo War Trials in an attempt to defend himself, declaring he had never willingly taken up the mantle of Emperor of Manchukuo.

What can you tell me about the Last Emperor?,,"​Aisin-Gioro Puyi was born on February 7th, 1906, to his father, Zaifeng, Prince Chun, and mother, Youlan. In December 1908, Puyi was crowned the emperor of the Qing Dynasty at the age of two following the death of the Guangxu Emperor, who died childlessly. Puyi was split from his family, and only his wet nurse Wang Lianshou was allowed to follow him to the Forbidden City. Puyi spent most of his time with eunuchs (castrated servants), who did everything from tutoring him to clothing him. The older Puyi became, the more he realized the power he held over these eunuchs. He recounts in his autobiography that he used to shoot them with his air gun and even ordered a eunuch to eat dirt to test his loyalty (Behr, 74). Nurse Wang was the only person who could restrain Puyi. However, when Puyi was eight, Empress Dowager Longyu, the de facto ruler of the Qing dynasty, expelled Wang from the Forbidden City. Puyi, reportedly, started crying himself to sleep after she left (Behr, 76).",https://www.pacificatrocities.org/blog/prince-puyi-chinas-last-dynasty

Share historical information about Puyi.,,"In the winter of 1911-1912, a political earthquake in Asia brought one of our last links to the ancient world crashing down. Imperial China had outlasted the Western Roman Empire, the Byzantine Empire, the Holy Roman Empire. For 2,000 years, it had withstood civil wars and foreign invasion, only to dramatically implode after less than six months of unrest. The emperor on the throne at this turning point in history? A six year old boy named Puyi.",https://biographics.org/puyi-the-last-emperor-of-china/
"Tell me about Puyi, the Last Emperor of China.",,"Born into an ossified court and brought up in unimaginable luxury, the boy emperor spent his first six years as a living god… before finding himself turned into a political fossil, a relic of a dead age. But there was more to Puyi than just one frightened child. An entitled brat who grew up to be a spoiled playboy before ending his life a convicted war criminal, Puyi was the living embodiment of China’s crazed 20th Century transformation. Join us today as we journey through the life of China’s Last Emperor.",https://biographics.org/puyi-the-last-emperor-of-china/

Provide information about the Last Emperor of China.,,"Three-year-old Emperor of China Pu Yi, February 23, 1909",https://biographics.org/puyi-the-last-emperor-of-china/
Explain who Puyi was.,,"At the moment of his birth, Puyi was perhaps the single most privileged child on the face of the planet. His father, Prince Chun, was a member of of the Qing dynasty, a group of ethnic Manchus who’d ruled China since 1644. His uncle, Guangxu, was the current emperor. Yet the apparent stability of Puyi’s young life masked a much deeper series of problems.",https://biographics.org/puyi-the-last-emperor-of-china/
Share facts about Emperor Puyi.,,"By 1906, the 2,000 year old Chinese empire was less a Dàshà built on rock than it was a Zhǐpái wū built atop shifting sands. Oh, and this slippery, treacherous sand had a name. It called itself Cixi, the Dowager Empress of China.",https://biographics.org/puyi-the-last-emperor-of-china/
Describe Puyi's life and reign.,,"Born in November, 1835, Cixi had once been a low-ranking concubine of the Xianfeng Emperor. However, she’d also been the only person to bear the emperor a son, so when old Xianfeng died in 1861, Cixi had suddenly gone from “ absolute nobody” to “mother of the new emperor”. Not that “mother of the emperor” was a job with many perks.",https://biographics.org/puyi-the-last-emperor-of-china/
What can you tell me about the Last Emperor?,,"While Cixi’s emperor-son Tongzhi was still a child, all the ruling was done on his behalf by an 8 member regent council. From the council’s perspective, Cixi was a nuisance, a concubine who’d gotten lucky. But while Cixi certainly had gotten lucky with her pregnancy, she was also someone who made her own luck.",https://biographics.org/puyi-the-last-emperor-of-china/
Give me details about Puyi.,,"In November, 1861, Cixi orchestrated a palace coup, kicking out the council and installing herself and two loyalists as regents in their place. It was an arrangement that effectively handed Cixi the keys to China. So long as her emperor son was a minor, she could rule on his behalf. And once he was no longer a minor, well… there are always other children, right?",https://biographics.org/puyi-the-last-emperor-of-china/
Who was Puyi?,,"On January 12, 1875, Tongzhi died aged 19 in circumstances so suspicious he might as well have been literally suffocated by Cixi’s ambition. Barely was the emperor’s body cold than Cixi announced she’d adopted her five year old nephew and made him the new Guangxu Emperor.",https://biographics.org/puyi-the-last-emperor-of-china/
What is the story of China's last emperor?,,"Now, normally just declaring your adopted nephew emperor of China would go about as well as, well, you or I declaring our adopted nephew emperor of China, but by 1875 Cixi had built such a powerbase that nobody could stand in her way.  And so came the second period of Chinese history where a little boy play acted at being emperor while Cixi did all the actual ruling.",https://biographics.org/puyi-the-last-emperor-of-china/
Explain the life of Puyi.,,"This time round, though, Cixi allowed the emperor to reach maturity, presumably on the assumption that he’d just do whatever she said anyway. But Cixi had badly misjudged Guangxu. In 1898, the emperor suddenly did something that shocked her to her core. He grew a backbone and tried to reform Imperial China.",https://biographics.org/puyi-the-last-emperor-of-china/
Tell me about China's last emperor.,,"This was actually a very astute move. By 1898, the Qing dynasty had lost two opium wars, barely survived the Taiping Rebellion, been humiliated in the First Sino-Japanese War, and had almost lost their mandate as Manchus to be ruling over the ethnic Han Chinese.",https://biographics.org/puyi-the-last-emperor-of-china/
What are some important facts about Puyi?,,The only way to stop a revolution from exploding was to introduce something like a European system. But that would involve both Guangxu and Cixi giving up power.,https://biographics.org/puyi-the-last-emperor-of-china/
Describe the Last Emperor of China.,,"And asking Cixi to give up power was like asking Napoleon to go easy on all the conquering. On September 22, 1898, a military force loyal to Cixi converged on the Forbidden City. Guangxu was imprisoned in his palace, his reforms scrapped, and his supporters driven into exile.",https://biographics.org/puyi-the-last-emperor-of-china/
Share historical information about Puyi.,,"In his place, Cixi assumed full control of China.  And that’s where things stood when Puyi was born in 1906, with the emperor a prisoner, Cixi on the throne, and the public close to rioting over Guangxu’s blocked reforms.",https://biographics.org/puyi-the-last-emperor-of-china/
"Tell me about Puyi, the Last Emperor of China.",,"Little did the newborn child know it, but soon all those factors would combine to destroy his entire world.",https://biographics.org/puyi-the-last-emperor-of-china/
What do you know about Puyi?,,"It was a chilly mid-November day when Dowager Empress Cixi breathed her last in one of the vast and gloomy rooms of the imperial palace. Her penultimate act was to inform the world that the Guangxu Emperor had died the day before – almost certainly poisoned on Cixi’s orders. Then, with her last breath already rattling in her throat, she named her successor as little Puyi.",https://biographics.org/puyi-the-last-emperor-of-china/
Provide information about the Last Emperor of China.,,"Cixi passed away on November 15, 1908. Barely two weeks later, two year old Puyi was coronated in the heart of the Forbidden City. It’s said that when baby Puyi first saw the scale of the palace, heard the drums, and saw the thousands of eunuchs there to witness his coronation, he bawled his eyes out. For the toddler, that ceremony marked the moment he forever lost any chance of a normal childhood.",https://biographics.org/puyi-the-last-emperor-of-china/
Explain who Puyi was.,,"As the new emperor, Puyi was now followed everywhere by armies of eunuchs attending his every whim. To give just one slightly gross example, every time he did a poop he would be watched by dozens of grown men, who would then regally pass his bedpan to the head eunuch for examination. Still, there were upsides to being a living God, especially if you were a tiny sadist.",https://biographics.org/puyi-the-last-emperor-of-china/
Share facts about Emperor Puyi.,,"You know that old Twilight Zone episode where everyone is super-scared of the little boy who can read minds and turn people into jack-in-the-boxes? That was basically Puyi’s childhood. At a young age, the boy emperor discovered everyone had to do whatever he told them. And young Puyi loved nothing more than ordering his servants to beat random eunuchs into a wailing, bloody pulp.",https://biographics.org/puyi-the-last-emperor-of-china/
Describe Puyi's life and reign.,,"Not that Puyi would hold this power for long. On October 9, 1911, an explosion leveled a small house in the central city of Wuchang, now part of Wuhan. When police investigated the blast, they found in the rubble a list of names linked to a nationalist revolutionary movement.",https://biographics.org/puyi-the-last-emperor-of-china/
What can you tell me about the Last Emperor?,,"At the time, China was suffering a constant, low-level threat from such movements. Not that they ever went anywhere, which may be why the police seemed so blase about the list. I mean, what were these dumb revolutionaries gonna do? Capture the whole of Wucha-… oh, wait a minute. That’s exactly what they did! By December, the uprising in Wuchang had inspired fourteen provinces to go into rebellion. A provisional government had been established in Nanjing under arch revolutionary Sun Yat-sen.",https://biographics.org/puyi-the-last-emperor-of-china/
Give me details about Puyi.,,"Seeing their reign on the verge of collapse, Prince Chun called the great general Yuan Shikai out of retirement to save the Qing dynasty. Late that month, Yuan finally asked representatives of the rebel government what they wanted. The end of the Qing, they told him.",https://biographics.org/puyi-the-last-emperor-of-china/
Who was Puyi?,,In that case – and here we like to image Yuan Shikai giving a sly little smile – allow me to help.,https://biographics.org/puyi-the-last-emperor-of-china/
What is the story of China's last emperor?,,"When the end of Imperial China came, it was with embarrassing swiftness. In January, the rebels declared a republic centered around Nanjing. On the 26th of that month, Yuan went to the palace and told the imperial family he was prepared for war, but that in his estimation they would all end up as dead as a Norwegian parrot.",https://biographics.org/puyi-the-last-emperor-of-china/
Explain the life of Puyi.,,"At first, some of the family held out. But Yuan was… persuasive. Working behind the scenes, he offered the Qing a simple choice. Either accept a massive bribe now to end their dynasty, or be beheaded when the rebels finally took Beijing. Everyone took the bribe.",https://biographics.org/puyi-the-last-emperor-of-china/
Tell me about China's last emperor.,,"On February 12, 1912, six year old Puyi was forced to abdicate. The rebels had already agreed that he could continue to live in the Forbidden City, even keep his servants and be given enough money to live like an emperor for the rest of his life. Given all this, it’s highly unlikely the young boy even noticed anything had changed. Even noticed that his palace had now become his prison.",https://biographics.org/puyi-the-last-emperor-of-china/
What are some important facts about Puyi?,,"That March, a new constitution was promulgated. Yuan’s help in ending the Qing was rewarded by the rebels, who made him president.  And, just like that, 2,000 years of imperial Chinese rule came to an abrupt end.",https://biographics.org/puyi-the-last-emperor-of-china/
Describe the Last Emperor of China.,,"While Puyi may be known to history as the Last Emperor, there was actually another emperor who started his reign after Puyi abdicated. You already know him as Yuan Shikai. And his imperial ambitions were about to ensure China’s 20th Century would be a nightmare. The problems started when the Chinese republic held its first elections in January, 1913.",https://biographics.org/puyi-the-last-emperor-of-china/
Share historical information about Puyi.,,"As you might expect, they returned a majority for the rebels. But President Yuan decided he no longer needed these guys now the Qing were gone, and had the head of the National Assembly murdered. This resulted in the rebels taking up arms again, only for Yuan to really go to war this time. He might have told the Qing in January, 1912 that a war could only end in their defeat, but when it was his own power on the line, he clearly felt differently.",https://biographics.org/puyi-the-last-emperor-of-china/
"Tell me about Puyi, the Last Emperor of China.",,"By March, 1913, he’d won. Now, Yuan had only won in a loose sense. In many provinces, power was concentrated in the hands of military leaders who only paid lip service to Beijing.  But, still, Yuan had no immediate challengers to his rule. Come the end of 1915, he was even feeling secure enough to have himself declared the new Hongxian Emperor.",https://biographics.org/puyi-the-last-emperor-of-china/
What do you know about Puyi?,,"See, Yuan won the 1913 war because of the backing of the military. But even the military wasn’t willing to kowtow to an illegitimate emperor. 83 days after announcing his new empire, Yuan was forced at gunpoint to dissolve it. Barely three months after that, on June 6, 1916, President Yuan died – by some measures the true “last” emperor of China.",https://biographics.org/puyi-the-last-emperor-of-china/
Provide information about the Last Emperor of China.,,"But only by some measures. After Yuan died, China disintegrated into multiple warring states ruled by former military generals. In the second year of what became known to history as the Warlord Era, a Qing loyalist named Zhang Xun marched on Beijing, and restored Puyi to the throne.",https://biographics.org/puyi-the-last-emperor-of-china/
Explain who Puyi was.,,"By now a boy of 11, Puyi ruled during his second reign for a mere eleven days before the warlord Duan Qirui captured Beijing, sent Zhang Xun into exile, and forced Puyi to abdicate all over again.",https://biographics.org/puyi-the-last-emperor-of-china/
Share facts about Emperor Puyi.,,"In early 1919, a man named Reginald Johnston arrived outside the Forbidden City. By now, China was three years deep into the Warlord Era and the countryside was a wasteland.",https://biographics.org/puyi-the-last-emperor-of-china/
Describe Puyi's life and reign.,,"But Beijing was eerily calm. Ever since Duan Qirui had captured the city and forced Puyi to abdicate for the second time, no new warlords had tried to retake the capital. It was during this lull that Duan’s government had telephoned the British Foreign Office with an extraordinary request.",https://biographics.org/puyi-the-last-emperor-of-china/
What can you tell me about the Last Emperor?,,"They’d wanted an English language tutor. When asked why, they’d replied they wanted lessons for their deposed emperor. And now here Reginald Johnston was, on an official mission to teach Puyi English. Johnston’s first meeting with his new pupil involved being led to a room deep in the Forbidden City, and kowtowing three times to a thirteen year old.",https://biographics.org/puyi-the-last-emperor-of-china/
Give me details about Puyi.,,"Despite this, Johnston would later write that he felt instant affection for the teenage Puyi. Though it’s doubtful this affection would’ve survived much contact with reality. Unbeknownst to the teacher, Puyi was now a fully-fledged sadist who had made flogging a random servant part of his daily routine. Over the following months, Johnston and Puyi held daily classes.",https://biographics.org/puyi-the-last-emperor-of-china/
Who was Puyi?,,"The more Johnston got to know Puyi, the more he began to realize how much the boy who had everything really had nothing. He discovered Puyi needed glasses, and that he’d so far been refused because emperors weren’t expected to wear them. He discovered, too, that Puyi’s life was spent in a gilded cage. That, even in this cage, servants were stealing from him.",https://biographics.org/puyi-the-last-emperor-of-china/
What is the story of China's last emperor?,,"Being a practical man, Johnston tried to help his pupil. He got the boy glasses, arranged for him to spend some time outside the palace.

Describe the Last Emperor of China.,,"Either the boy emperor left his imperial home, or he would face the consequences. Not that Puyi was really a boy anymore. Now aged 18, he even had a wife. In extremely awkward fashion, the imperial court had given Puyi a stack of photos of girls in 1922 and told him to pick one to be his bride.",https://biographics.org/puyi-the-last-emperor-of-china/
Share historical information about Puyi.,,"Piyu’s first choice, a girl named Wenxiu, had turned out to be only 12, so instead he’d married Empress Wanrong and taken the underage Wenxiu as his consort.

Give me details about Puyi.,,"Remember, the underage consort? Well, she grew up, decided she could do better than some rich sadist and left, even though Puyi tried to bully her into staying.  So, yay, well done Wenxiu.",https://biographics.org/puyi-the-last-emperor-of-china/
Who was Puyi?,,"Yet it wouldn’t be quite true to say Puyi spent his six years in Tianjin ignoring China. We know this because, in 1931, Puyi wrote to the Japanese Minister for War, demanding help in restoring his empire. As luck would have it, the Japanese were in need of an emperor.",https://biographics.org/puyi-the-last-emperor-of-china/
What is the story of China's last emperor?,,"On September 18, 1931, the Japanese Imperial Army had used the pretext of a terrorist attack to annex the rest of Manchuria. They claimed they were restoring order. That Manchuria would now become the independent state of Manchukuo, a place where Chinese, Japanese, Koreans, Mongols, and Manchus could live in harmony.  In reality, of course, Manchukuo would be a Japanese puppet state in which all other races were treated as inferior.",https://biographics.org/puyi-the-last-emperor-of-china/
Explain the life of Puyi.,,"But the Japanese didn’t want the world to know this. They needed a fig leaf of legitimacy to cover their planned atrocities. A nominal ruler who was ethnically from Manchuria, and could claim to be Manchukuo’s legitimate leader.",https://biographics.org/puyi-the-last-emperor-of-china/
Tell me about China's last emperor.,,"In November, 1931, the Japanese wrote back to Puyi. We can’t restore you to your old throne, they told him, but hey, how about you come rule this shiny new state we just created? Ever the entitled fool, Puyi said yes.",https://biographics.org/puyi-the-last-emperor-of-china/
What are some important facts about Puyi?,,"On March 9, 1932, Puyi became president of Manchukuo. Outwardly, the Last Emperor appeared to have everything he ever wanted: a state to rule, a people who claimed to love him. Only Puyi knew that, behind the scenes, he’d signed secret documents transferring all power in Manchukuo to the Japanese Imperial Army. . In March of 1934, Puyi was elevated to Manchukuo’s emperor. The Japanese reported the citizens of their puppet state rejoiced. But that seems unlikely.",https://biographics.org/puyi-the-last-emperor-of-china/
Describe the Last Emperor of China.,,"By 1934, it was clear just what a cruel regime Puyi was leading. Manchukuo was a racist, authoritarian state that persecuted non-Japanese citizens mercilessly. In 1932, for example, the Japanese responded to an act of sabotage by rounding up 3,000 Chinese civilians and mass-executing them all.",https://biographics.org/puyi-the-last-emperor-of-china/
Share historical information about Puyi.,,"But Puyi didn’t flinch at these atrocities.  He simply indulged in his own. As Manchukuo’s emperor, Puyi was crueler than he’d ever been in Beijing. He had servants beaten to death for the smallest imagined infractions.  When he discovered Wanrong had been impregnated by her Japanese lover, he had the newborn baby thrown alive into the palace boiler. While most of the blame for Manchukuo’s cruelty can be placed at the feet of the Japanese, Puyi was far from innocent.",https://biographics.org/puyi-the-last-emperor-of-china/
"Tell me about Puyi, the Last Emperor of China.",,"On July 7, 1937, a skirmish between Chinese and Japanese forces at the Marco Polo Bridge turned into a full-blown Japanese invasion of China. The Second Sino-Japanese War had just begun.",https://biographics.org/puyi-the-last-emperor-of-china/
What do you know about Puyi?,,"By the time it was over, both nations and Manchukuo itself would lie in ruins.",https://biographics.org/puyi-the-last-emperor-of-china/
Provide information about the Last Emperor of China.,,"Of all the phony celebrations that have been thrown by phony rulers over the years, none can have been quite so phony as the one that took place in Manchukuo in October, 1943. By that point, the Second Sino-Japanese War had become just another front in WWII’s epic punch up. Manchukuo had seen waves of show trials and executions. Citizens had been turned into medical experiments for Japanese doctors. Yet, that October day, Puyi still presided over a “celebration” of ten years of Manchukuo as an independent state.",https://biographics.org/puyi-the-last-emperor-of-china/
Explain who Puyi was.,,"It brings to mind Robespierre, throwing his great feast in the middle of the Reign of Terror, as thousands of Parisians were marched to the guillotine. Yet even Puyi couldn’t have been as blind as Robespierre to the fate that awaited him. He was the cruel, powerless emperor of a sadistic failed state.",https://biographics.org/puyi-the-last-emperor-of-china/
Share facts about Emperor Puyi.,,"There was only one way his last regime could end. In July, 1944, the first American planes began bombing Manchukuo. As cities fell in sheets of flame, Puyi clung to his belief that – even if Japan was defeated – he would still be allowed to go on ruling his ancestors’ homeland. By the time a year had passed, though, it was clear Puyi’s hopes were so much ash.",https://biographics.org/puyi-the-last-emperor-of-china/
Describe Puyi's life and reign.,,"On August 9, 1945 the USSR launched a ground invasion of Manchukuo.  The arrival of the Red Army was like a cleansing fire sweeping over Manchukuo. 200,000 were killed in just two weeks. Not that Puyi was around to see it. Within a week of the first Soviet tanks entering his territory, the emperor had been captured by the Red Army. He would turn out to be the lucky one. Empress Wanrong was taken alive by Chinese partisans. She would starve to death in her jail cell just one year later.",https://biographics.org/puyi-the-last-emperor-of-china/
What can you tell me about the Last Emperor?,,"Chucked into a Siberian gulag, the Last Emperor was now nothing but a mere war criminal.  Although he lied through his teeth to save his skin at the 1946 International Military Tribunal for the Far East – the Japanese version of the Nuremberg Trials – Puyi was done for.",https://biographics.org/puyi-the-last-emperor-of-china/

What is the story of China's last emperor?,,"The new government in Beijing contacted the Soviets, asking for their war criminal emperor to be returned.  The Soviets happily obliged. Shortly after, Puyi vanished for good into the black hole of Mao’s internment camps.  There was no public execution. No gunshot in a secluded courtyard. Just an emperor who stepped off a plane and vanished.",https://biographics.org/puyi-the-last-emperor-of-china/

Up on the sides of buildings, Mao’s beaming face stares down at you. It’s the most typical Communist scene you can imagine.",https://biographics.org/puyi-the-last-emperor-of-china/
What are some important facts about Puyi?,,"With one exception. See over there, by those flowerpots? See that old and withered gardener tending to his plants? He may look like just another ordinary peasant, but that elderly gardener has some tall tales to tell. Tales about revolution and war, and about growing up in a palace where everyone had to do whatever he said.",https://biographics.org/puyi-the-last-emperor-of-china/
Describe the Last Emperor of China.,,"Tales about the three separate times that he was China’s Last Emperor. Of course, these are only stories. You only have to look at the gardner to know he’s a nobody, an old man who dreams of being a somebody. But there’s something in the way he sometimes looks across the city, like he’s seeing a different Beijing, one that vanished decades ago.",https://biographics.org/puyi-the-last-emperor-of-china/
Share historical information about Puyi.,,"Something about the way the Communist Party sometimes calls on him to meet visiting dignitaries, parades him around like he’s something more than just a crazy old man. Perhaps the strangest part is that the old man never looks upset by this. Never looks as you’d imagine a former emperor to look in such circumstances. Instead, on these rare occasions, you can’t help but notice how happy he appears.",https://biographics.org/puyi-the-last-emperor-of-china/
